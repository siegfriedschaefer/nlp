## NLP - Natural Language Processing
*NLP* is a field of linguistics and machine learning trying to understand *everything related to human language*.
By doing this *NLP* tries to understand the context and the meaning of a sentence.

Common NLP tasks are


* ***[Classifying whole sentences](sentence_classification.qmd)***

* ***Classifying each word in a sentence***

* ***Generating text content***

* ***Extracting an answer from a text***

* ***Generating a news sentence from an input text***

I will examine a few topics of NLP to get somehow a feeling of how it works and how someone can use it.
I will start with the different tasks of *Classifying whole sentences*.
